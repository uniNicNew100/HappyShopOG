/**
 * The DatabaseRW interface defines the contract for interacting with the product database.
 * It is currently implemented by the DerbyRW class, which provides the actual functionality.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Searching for products by keyword or product ID.
 * - Performing stock updates and validations during purchases.
 * - Updating, deleting, or inserting products.
 * - Checking whether a product ID is available before insertion.
 *
 * Why use this interface:
 * Introducing this interface allows for better separation of specification and implementation,
 * making the system more adaptable and maintainable.
 *
 * 1. **Ease of Substitution**: If the application switches to a different database system
 *    (e.g., from Derby to MySQL or SQLite), a new implementation can be provided without affecting other components.
 *
 * 2. **Improved Testability**: During unit testing, mock implementations can simulate database behavior,
 *    enabling effective testing without requiring a live database connection.
